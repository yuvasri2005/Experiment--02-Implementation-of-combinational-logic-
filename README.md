# Experiment--02-Implementation-of-combinational-logic
Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
## Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
## Software – Quartus prime


## Theory

A combinational logic circuit implement logic functions where its output depends only on its current combination of input values. on the other hand sequential circuits,unlike combinational logic, have state or memory. 

some logic operations may require more than one logic gate. Different combinations of gates are designed for different operations. the brhaviour ofvthe combined logic gates can be determined by constructing a truth table of the combined gate

## Procedure

1.create a project with required entities. 

2.create a module along with respective file name. 

3.run the respective programs for tha given boolean equations. 

4.run the module and get the respective RTL otuputs. 

5.create a university program(VWF)foe getting timming diagram. 

6.give the respective input for the timming diagram and obtain the result. 


## Program:

Program to implement the given logic function and to verify its operations in quartus using Verilog programming.
